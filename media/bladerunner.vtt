WEBVTT - Blade Runner 2049

00:14.240 --> 00:17.155
Every civilization 

00:18.265 --> 00:23.535
was built off the back of a disposable workforce,  

00:24.775 --> 00:30.265
But I can only make so many. Shhhh. Happy birthday.

00:35.152 --> 00:37.152
There is an order to things.

00:39.079 --> 00:43.514
That's what we do here. We keep order. 

00:47.029 --> 00:49.654
The world is built on a wall that separates kind. 

00:51.192 --> 00:53.192
Tell either side there's no wall...

00:54.666 --> 00:56.666
You bought a war.

01:02.285 --> 01:04.285
  You're a cop. 

01:04.776 --> 01:06.776
I did your job once. 

01:07.933 --> 01:09.518
I was good at it.

01:16.066 --> 01:17.781
 I know.

01:17.844 --> 01:19.844
What do you want?

01:19.934 --> 01:21.934
I want to ask you some questions.

NOTE ABOUT RACHEL! The questions are about Rachel!!!

01:28.001 --> 01:30.001
The key to the future...

01:32.242 --> 01:34.242
Is finally unearthed.

01:35.912 --> 01:37.912
Bring it to me.

01:40.243 --> 01:42.243
They know you're here.

01:55.949 --> 01:58.894
I always told you... you're special.

02:02.103 --> 02:04.593
 Your story isn't over yet. 

02:05.001 --> 02:07.001
There's still a page left.
