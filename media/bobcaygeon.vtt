WEBVTT - Bobcaygeon by The Tragically Hip

1
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:29.040
Left your house this mornin'

2
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.480
about a quarter after nine.

3
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.080
could have been the Willie Nelson.
Could have been the wine.

4
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:54.800
When I left your house
this morning, it was a little after nine.

5
00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:03.860
It was in Bobcaygeon,
I saw the constellations 

6
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.920
Reveal themselves one star at a time.

7
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.480
Drove back to town this morning

8
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.520
With working on my mind.

9
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.960
I thought of maybe quittin.

10
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.080
I thought of leaving it behind

11
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.640
I went back to bed this morning

12
00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.080
And as I'm pulling down the blinds

13
00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.800
Yeah, the sky was dull.

14
00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.280
And hypothetical

15
00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.960
And falling one cloud at a time.

16
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.800
That night in Toronto

17
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.640
With it's checkerboard floors

18
00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.920
Riding on horseback.

19
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.400
And keeping order restored

20
00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.080
'Til the men, they couldn't hang

21
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.780
Stepped to the mic and sang...

  
22
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:27.080
And their voices rang with that Aryan twang

23
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.200
I go to your house this morning.

24
00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.840
Just a little after nine

25
00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.320
In the middle of that riot

26
00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.320
Couldn't get you off my mind

27
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.960
So I'm at your house this morning

28
00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.720
Just a little after nine

29
00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.080
'Cause it was in Bobcaygeon

30
00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:30.920
where I saw the constellations
Reveal themselves one star at a time
